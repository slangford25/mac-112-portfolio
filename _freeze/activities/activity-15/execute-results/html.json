To prepare, and for consistency across students:\n\n- Make sure your portfolio repository is opened in RStudio as a project\n- Go to your the main directory by clicking the hexagon shaped button in the upper right corner of the **Files** pane\n- Create a new folder called **data**\n\n:::\n\n**WHERE ARE WE?**\n\nWe've thus far focused on data preparation and visualization:\n\n![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/legos.png)\n\nWhat's coming up?\n\n-   In the last \\~4-5 weeks we'll focus on data storytelling through the completion of a course project.\n\n-   In the next \\~1 week we'll address the other gaps in the workflow: data collection and analysis. We'll do so in the context of starting a data project...\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n**Starting a data project**\n\nAny data science project consists of two phases:\n\n1.  data collection\\\n    A data project starts with data! Thus far, you've either been given data, or used TidyTuesday data. In this unit:\n\n    -   We *will* explore how to find data, save data, import this data into RStudio, and do some preliminary data cleaning.\n    -   We *won't* discuss how to collect data from scratch (e.g. via experiment, observational study, or survey).\n\n2.  data analysis\\\n    Once we have data, we need to do some analysis. In this unit...\n\n    -   We *will* bring together our wrangling & visualization tools to discuss **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. EDA is the process of getting to know our data, obtaining insights from data, and using these insights to formulate, refine, and explore research questions.\n\n    -   We will *not* explore other types of analysis, such as modeling & prediction--if interested, take STAT 155 and 253 to learn more about these topics.\n\n**NOTE:** These skills are best learned through practice. We'll just scratch the surface here.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Warm-up\n\nBefore exploring how to find, store, import, check, and clean data, it's important to recognize that **data can be stored in various formats**. We've been working with `.csv` files. In the background, these have \"comma-separated values\" (csv):\n\n\\\n\n![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/bikes_csv.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n\\\n\nBut there are many other common file types. For example, the following are compatible with R:\n\n-   Excel files: `.xls`, `.xlsx`\n-   R \"data serialization\" files: `.rds`\n-   files with tab-separated values: `.tsv`\n\n![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/bikes_tsv.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### STEP 1: Finding data files {.unnumbered}\n\nData repositories are best when you're not looking for specific data. Here are just a few:\n\n-   TidyTuesday\n-   [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) (includes links to other data repositories at the end)\n-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)\n-   [data.world](https://data.world/)\n-   [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets)\n-   [sports data collection by Ohio State U](https://sportsandsociety.osu.edu/sports-data-sets)\n-   [This Trello board](https://trello.com/b/XDsCYdGT/data-sets) contains links to dataset repositories as well as links to datasets that cover different domains\n\nBut when we're searching for more specific data, search engines like Google are typically better. For example, try searching for:\n\n`pet adoption data`\n\nThe word *data* is very broad! Matches could include articles that just have some simple statistics. For *data* in the sense that we mean it, e.g. a data *table*, we can use a more specific search:\n\n`pet adoption filetype:csv`\n\nYou could also try other common file types that are compatible with R: `.tsv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.rds`\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### STEP 2: Saving a local copy of the data file {.unnumbered}\n\nUnless we're just doing a quick, one-off data analysis, it's important to store a local copy of a data file, i.e. save the data file to our own machine.\n\nMainly, we shouldn't rely on another person / institution to store a data file online, in the same place, forever!\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Saving Data\"}\n\nSaving your data...\n\n-   in a nice format (e.g. as a csv file)\n-   where you'll be able to find it again\n-   ideally, within a folder that's *dedicated* to the related project / assignment\n-   alongside the Rmd file(s) where you'll record your analysis of the data\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### STEP 3: Importing the data file into RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce we have a local copy of our data file, we need to get it into RStudio! This process depends on 2 things: (1) the file *type* (e.g. .csv); and (2) the file *location*, i.e. where it's stored on your computer.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n**1. FILE TYPE**\n\nThe file type indicates which *function* we'll need to import it. The table below lists some common import functions and when to use them.\n\n| Function       | Data file type                                            |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| `read_csv()`   | .csv - you can save Excel files and Google Sheets as .csv |\n| `read_delim()` | other delimited formats (tab, space, etc.)                |\n| `read_sheet()` | Google Sheet                                              |\n| `st_read()`    | spatial data shapefile                                    |\n\nNOTE: In comparison to `read.csv`, `read_csv` is faster when importing large data files and can more easily parse complicated datasets, eg, with dates, times, percentages.\n\n\\\n\\\n\n**2. FILE LOCATION**\n\nTo import the data, we apply the appropriate function from above to the **file path**.\n\nA file path is an address to where the file is stored on our computer or the web.\n\nConsider \"1600 Grand Ave, St. Paul, MN 55105\". Think about how different parts of the address give increasingly more specific information about the location. \"St. Paul, MN 55105\" tells us the city and smaller region within the city, \"Grand Ave\" tells us the street, and \"1600\" tells us the specific location on the street.\n\nIn the example below, the file path is absolute where it tells us the location giving more and more specific information as you read it from left to right.\n\n-   \"\\~\", on an Apple computer, tells you that you are looking in the user's home directory.\n-   \"Desktop\" tells you to go to the Desktop within that home directory.\n-   \"112\" tells you that you are looking in the 112 folder on the Desktop.\n-   \"data\" tells you to next go in the data folder in the 112 folder.\n-   \"my_data.csv\" tells you that you are looking for a file called my_data.csv location within the data folder.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data <- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/112/data/my_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### STEP 4: Preliminary data checks and cleaning {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce the data is loaded, ask yourself a few questions:\n\nWhat's the structure of the data?\n\n-   Use `str()` to learn about the numbers of variables and observations as well as the classes or types of variables (date, location, string, factor, number, boolean, etc.)\n-   Use `head()` to view the top of the data table\n-   Use `View()` to view the data in a spreadsheet-like viewer\n\nIs there anything goofy that we need to clean before we can analyze the data?\n\n-   Is it in a tidy format?\n-   How many rows are there? What does the row mean? What is an observation?\n-   Is there consistent formatting for categorical variables?\n-   Is there missing data that needs to be addressed?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### STEP 5: Understanding the data {.unnumbered}\n\nStart by understanding the data that is available to you. If you have a codebook, you have struck gold! If not (the more common case), you'll need to do some detective work that often involves talking to people.\n\nAt this stage, ask yourself:\n\n-   Where does my data come from? How was it collected?[^15-data-import-1]\n-   Is there a codebook? If not, how can I learn more about it?\n-   Are there people I can reach out to who have experience with this data?\n\n[^15-data-import-1]: Particularly important questions about how it was collected include WHO (whether it is a sample of a larger data set, and, if so, how the sampling was done? Randomly? All cases during a specific time frame? All data for a selected set of users?), WHEN (is this current data or historical? what events may have had an impact?), WHAT (what variables were measured? how was it measured, self-reported through a questionnaire or measured directly?), WHY (who funded the data collection? for what purposes what the data collected? to whose benefit was the data collected?) Answers to such questions strongly impact the conclusions you will be able to draw from the data.\n\n## Exercises\n\nSuppose our goal is to work with data on movie reviews, and that we've already gone through the work to find a dataset. The \"imdb_5000_messy.csv\" file is posted on Moodle. Let's work with it!\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 1: Save a local copy of the data file {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nOn your laptop:\n\n-   Download the \"imdb_5000_messy.csv\" file from Moodle\n-   Move it to the *data* folder you created at the beginning of class\n\n#### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it's important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new Rmd (eg: \"imdb_5000_messy_README.Rmd\") or in the Rmd where you'll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\n-   the data *source*, i.e. where you *found* the data\n-   the data *creator*, i.e. who / what group *collected* the original data\n-   possibly a data *codebook*, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\n\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data *source* and *creator*.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 2: Import the data into RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let's get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file *type* and *location*. Since our file *type* is a csv, we can import it using `read_csv()`. But we have to supply the file *location* through a file path. To this end, we can either use an **absolute file path** or a **relative file path**.\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\n-   On a Mac: `~`\n-   On Windows: typically `C:\\`\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\n-   On a Mac: `~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv`\n-   On Windows: `C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv` or `C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv`\n\nPutting this together, use `read_csv()` with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as `imdb_messy`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nimdb_messy <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/GitHub/stat112/mac-112-portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead **relative file paths** should be used.  A **relative file path** describes the location of a file from the current \"working directory\", i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is *inside this Rmd*:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This should be the folder where you stored this Rmd!\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Users/SidneyLangford/Documents/GitHub/stat112/mac-112-portfolio/activities\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the *console* by typing `getwd()` in the *console*. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your Rmd won't work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your Rmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session \\> Set Working Directory \\> To Source File location.\n\n#### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\nAs is good practice, we created a `data` folder and saved our data file (`imdb_5000_messy.csv`) into.\n\nSince our .Rmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don't have to write out *absolute file paths* that go all the way to the root directory. We can use *relative file paths* that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\n-   On a Mac: `../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv`\n-   On Windows: `..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv` or `..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv`\n\n**NOTE**: `..` means go one level up in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\n\nPutting this together, use `read_csv()` with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as `imdb_temp` (`temp` for \"temporary\"). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as `imdb_messy`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_temp <- read_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"File Paths\"}\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, `https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv`.  In all other instances, relative file paths are recommended.\n\n:::\n\n#### Part d: OPTIONAL {.unnumbered}\n\nSometimes, we don't want to import the *entire* dataset. For example, we might want to...\n\n-   skips some rows (eg: if they're just \"filler\")\n-   only import the *first* \"n\" rows (eg: if the dataset is really large)\n-   only import a *random* subset of \"n\" rows (eg: if the dataset is really large)...\n\nThe \"data import cheat sheet\" at the top of this Rmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example...\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Commenting/Uncommenting Code\"}\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click <kbd>ctrl/cmd+shift+c</kbd>.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\nread_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\", n_max = 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  <dbl> <chr> <chr>                              <dbl>    <dbl>\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     5 <NA>  Doug Walker                           NA       NA\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes <dbl>,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes <dbl>, actor_2_name <chr>,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes <dbl>, gross <dbl>, genres <chr>,\n#   actor_1_name <chr>, movie_title <chr>, num_voted_users <dbl>,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes <dbl>, actor_3_name <chr>,\n#   facenumber_in_poster <dbl>, plot_keywords <chr>, movie_imdb_link <chr>,\n#   num_user_for_reviews <dbl>, language <chr>, country <chr>, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 3: Preliminary data checks {.unnumbered}\n\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nOpen `imdb_messy` in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing `View(imdb_messy)` in the console.

Let's make that happen.\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nWe *could* open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the `color` variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this Rmd, to clean our data?\n\n#### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's use R code to change the `color` variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: `Color` and `Black_White`. We've learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the `imdb_messy` data, change the `color` variable using one of the functions we learned in Activity 12:\n\n`fct_relevel()`, `fct_recode()`, `fct_reorder()`\n\nStore your results in `imdb_temp` (don't overwrite `imdb_messy`). To check your work, print out a `count()` table of the `color` variable in `imdb_temp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_temp <- imdb_messy %>% \n  mutate(color = fct_recode(color,\n                            \"Color\" = \"Color\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"COLOR\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"color\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"B&W\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"Black and White\"))\nimdb_temp %>%   \n  count(color)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  <fct>       <int>\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 <NA>           19\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String chpater:\n\n`str_replace()`, `str_replace_all()`, `str_to_lower()`, `str_sub()`, `str_length()`, `str_detect()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_temp <- imdb_messy %>% \n  mutate(color = str_replace(color, \"COLOR\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"color\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"B&W\", \"Black_White\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"Black and White\", \"Black_White\"))\n\nimdb_temp %>%   \n  count(color)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  <chr>       <int>\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 <NA>           19\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 6: Preliminary cleaning -- missing data 1 {.unnumbered}\n\nThroughout these exercises, you've probably noticed that there's a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as `NA` (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n-   *How many* values are missing data? What's the volume of the missingness?\n-   *Why* are some values missing?\n-   *What* should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet's consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nAs a first step, let's simply understand the *volume* of NAs.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about...\n\n-   why the values are missing\n-   what we want to do with our data\n-   the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions\n\n#### Part a {.unnumbered}\n\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA's?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_messy %>% \n  summarize(avg = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    avg\n  <dbl>\n1  107.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis?\n\n#### Part b {.unnumbered}\n\nTry out the `drop_na()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_temp <- drop_na(imdb_messy)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\n-   What did `drop_na()` do? How many data points are left?\n-   In what situations might this function be a good idea?\n-   In what situations might this function be a bad idea?\n\n#### Part c {.unnumbered}\n\n`drop_na()` removes data points that have *any* NA values, even if we don't care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that *do* have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film `duration` and whether it's in `color`. Check out a plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n   geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](activity-15_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\n-   Create a new dataset with *only* and *all* movies that have complete info on `duration` and `color`. HINT: You could use `!is.na(___)` or `drop_na()` (differently than above)\n\n-   Use this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\n\n-   How many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimdb_color <- imdb_messy %>% \n  select(duration, color) %>% \n  drop_na()\nggplot(imdb_color, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n   geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](activity-15_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Part d {.unnumbered}\n\nIn some cases, missing data is more *non*-data than *unknown* data. For example, the films with NAs for `actor_1_facebook_likes` actually have *0* Facebook likes -- they don't even have actors! In these cases, we can *replace* the NAs with a 0. Use the `replace_na()` function to create a new dataset (`imdb_temp`) that replaces the NAs in `actor_1_facebook_likes` with 0. You'll have to check out the help file for this function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n### Exercise 8: New data + projects {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you're sitting with today aren't necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\n-   Share with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you've been thinking about or things you'd like to learn more about? Don't think too hard about this!
