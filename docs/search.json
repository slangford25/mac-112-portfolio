When do we use it? - the + indicates that another function is being added to the ggplot function.\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? - It indicates that the graph is geometric\nWhat does labs() stand for? - labs() stands for labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? - color changes the color of the border, fill changes the color of the entire bar.\nPart b In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable: observed categories: What categories did we observe? - difficulty\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? - moderate is by far the most common category\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nPart c Is there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again. - the x-axis is in alphabetical order not order of difficulty.\nExercise 6\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is NOT an effective visualization because it creates a new bar for every unique elevation, making the bars small and difficult to read as very few peaks have the exact same elevation.\nExercise 8\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nRepublican support in 2020 and 2016 have a strong positive correlation.

In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes Though the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot: colors != historical colors, plots stacked on top of each other so hard to read\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do? Changes the colors manually\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do? Makes the fill of the plots 50% transparent\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?! Makes 3 different plots\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot. uggo, hard to read\n# Why is this terrible?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10 We’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\nWhich do you like best? boxplots\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? can get more details (in terms of the numbers you get)\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? specifics get lost\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check Finally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical Construct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a Name one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nPart b What’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?",

    "text": "Example 1\nConstruct a plot that allows us to examine how temp3pm varies.\n\n\nExample 2\nConstruct 3 plots that address the following research question:\nHow do afternoon temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\n\n# Plot 1 (no facets & starting from a density plot of temp3pm)\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2 (no facets or densities)\n\n\n# Plot 3 (facets)\n\n\nReflection\n\nTemperatures tend to be highest, and most variable, in Uluru. There, they range from ~10 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~30 degrees.\nTemperatures tend to be lowest in Hobart. There, they range from ~5 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~15 degrees.\nWollongong temps are in between and are the least variable from day to day.\n\nSUBTLETIES: Defining fill or color by a variable\nHow we define the fill or color depends upon whether we’re defining it by a named color or by some variable in our dataset. For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")\nnamed colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong. Represent each day on the plot and use a curve/line to help highlight the trends.\n\n# THINK: What variable goes on the y-axis?\n# For the curve, try adding span = 0.5 to tweak the curvature\n\n\n# Instead of a curve that captures the general TREND,\n# draw a line that illustrates the movement of RAW temperatures from day to day\n# NOTE: We haven't learned this geom yet! Guess.\nggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: A line plot isn’t always appropriate! It can be useful in situations like this, when our data are chronological.\n\nReflection\nThere’s a seasonal / cyclic behavior in temperatures – they’re highest in January (around 23 degrees) and lowest in July (around 16 degrees). There are also some outliers – some abnormally hot and cold days.",

    "text": "3.2 New Stuff\nNext, let’s consider the entire weather data for all 3 locations. The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\n\nExample 5\n\n# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Not Get Overwhelmed?\n\n\n\nThere’s no end to the number and type of visualizations you could make. And it’s important to not just throw spaghetti at the wall until something sticks. FlowingData shows that one dataset can be visualized many ways, and makes good recommendations for data viz workflow, which we modify and build upon here:\n\nIdentify simple research questions.\nWhat do you want to understand about the variables or the relationships among them?\nStart with the basics and work incrementally.\n\nIdentify what variables you want to include in your plot and what structure these have (eg: categorical, quantitative, dates)\nStart simply. Build a plot of just 1 of these variables, or the relationship between 2 of these variables.\nSet up a plotting frame and add just one geometric layer at a time.\nStart tweaking: add whatever new variables you want to examine,\n\nAsk your plot questions.\n\nWhat questions does your plot answer? What questions are left unanswered by your plot?\nWhat new questions does your plot spark / inspire?\nDo you have the viz tools to answer these questions, or might you learn more?\n\nFocus.\nReporting a large number of visualizations can overwhelm the audience and obscure your conclusions. Instead, pick out a focused yet comprehensive set of visualizations.",

    "text": "3.3 Exercises (required)\n\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\n\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\n\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?) The plot is right skewed with several blank spots in the center. the blank spaces may be due to how the SAT is scored, meaning its easier to get some scores rather than others.\n\n\n\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\n\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you? there is a weak negative relationship between SAT scores and spending meaning that expenditures do not help increase SAT scores and can actually harm them.\n\n\n\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= salary, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\n\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\n\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?",

Let’s start with a heat map.\n\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\n\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",

    "text": "4.3 Exercises\n\n4.3.1 Preview\nYou’ll explore some R spatial viz tools below. In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\n\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\n\n\n4.3.2 Part 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\n\n\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       46      -123\n2       33        52\n3       48       -90\n4       36      -112\n5       59        25\n6       39      -106\n\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\n# leaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") %&gt;%\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) %&gt;%\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks %&gt;%   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Part 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\n\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(x=Longitude, y = Latitude)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\n\n\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\n\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# What does this code produce?\n# What geom are we using for the point map?\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# How does this change how we use geom_point?!\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nSummarize what you learned about Starbucks from this map. There are a lot of starbucks in north america, europe, eastern china, and japan\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united states of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\n\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\n# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks %&gt;% \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\n# cma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n#   country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n#   returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\n# Just the boundaries\n#ggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n # geom_sf()\n\n\n# Add the points\n# And zoom in\n#ggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n#  geom_sf() + \n#  geom_point(\n#    data = starbucks_cma,\n #   aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n  #  alpha = 0.3,\n   # size = 0.2,\n#    color = \"darkgreen\"\n # ) +\n  #coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  #theme_map()\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\n\n\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nstarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks %&gt;% \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states. This requires st_as_sf() in the sf package, and map() in the maps package, where the countries are labeled ‘minnesota’, ‘north dakota’, etc.\n\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# Get the boundaries\nmidwest_boundaries &lt;- st_as_sf(\n  maps::map(\"county\",\n            region = c(\"minnesota\", \"wisconsin\", \"north dakota\", \"south dakota\"), \n            fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(midwest_boundaries)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.81268 ymin: 45.05167 xmax: -93.01397 ymax: 48.53526\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs +type=crs\n                                     ID                           geom\nminnesota,aitkin       minnesota,aitkin MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.03689 4...\nminnesota,anoka         minnesota,anoka MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.51817 4...\nminnesota,becker       minnesota,becker MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.14537 4...\nminnesota,beltrami   minnesota,beltrami MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.58655 4...\nminnesota,benton       minnesota,benton MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.77027 4...\nminnesota,big stone minnesota,big stone MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.10794 4...\n\n\n\nPart b\nAdjust the code below to make the plot!

Consider the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US that we mapped earlier:\n\n# Point map (we made this earlier)\n#ggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n#  geom_sf() + \n # geom_point(\n  #  data = starbucks_cma,\n   # aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    #alpha = 0.3,\n  #  size = 0.2,\n   # color = \"darkgreen\"\n # ) +\n#  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n#  theme_map()\n\nNow check out the contour map.\n\n# What changed in the plot?\n# What changed in our code?!\n#ggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n # geom_sf() + \n # geom_density_2d(\n#    data = starbucks_cma,\n  #  aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n  #  size = 0.2,\n   # color = \"darkgreen\"\n # ) +\n # coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n#  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Part 3: Choropleth maps\nSpatial data isn’t always in the form of point locations! For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state %&gt;% \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\n\n\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.) Instead, we can use the map_data() function from the ggplot2 package:\n\n\n# Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of state boundaries\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(states_map)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\n\nPause\nImportant detail: Note that the region variable in states_map, and the state_name variable in elections_by_state both label states by the full name in lower case letters.

Our elections_by_counties data refers to each county by a county_fips code, which is mostly the same as id, BUT drops any 0’s at the beginning of the code.\n\nhead(county_map)\n\n     long      lat order  hole piece            group    id\n1 1225889 -1275020     1 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n2 1235324 -1274008     2 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n3 1244873 -1272331     3 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n4 1244129 -1267515     4 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n5 1272010 -1262889     5 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n6 1276797 -1295514     6 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n\nhead(elections_by_counties)\n\n  state_name state_abbr    county_name county_fips repub_pct_20 median_age\n1    Alabama         AL Autauga County        1001        71.44       37.5\n2    Alabama         AL Baldwin County        1003        76.17       41.5\n3    Alabama         AL Barbour County        1005        53.45       38.3\n4    Alabama         AL    Bibb County        1007        78.43       39.4\n5    Alabama         AL  Blount County        1009        89.57       39.6\n6    Alabama         AL Bullock County        1011        24.84       39.6\n  median_rent repub_20_categories\n1         668               70-79\n2         693               70-79\n3         382               50-59\n4         351               70-79\n5         403               80-89\n6         276               20-29\n\n\nThis just means that we have to wrangle the data so that it can communicate with the background map.\n\n# Add 0's at the beginning of any fips_code that's fewer than 5 numbers long\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties %&gt;% \n  mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(county_fips = \n           ifelse(nchar(county_fips) == 4, paste0(\"0\", county_fips), county_fips))\n\n\n\nPart b\nNow map Republican support by county.

For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first.\nWe’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state %&gt;% \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\n# Add 0's at the beginning of any fips_code that's fewer than 5 numbers long\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties %&gt;% \n  mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(county_fips = \n           ifelse(nchar(county_fips) == 4, paste0(\"0\", county_fips), county_fips))\n\n\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\n\nPart d\ngeom_map()\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Play around!\n\nggplot(elections_by_counties, aes(map_id = county_fips, fill = median_rent)) +\n  geom_map(map = county_map) +\n  expand_limits(x = county_map$long, y = county_map$lat) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") + \n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(name = \"median rent\", colors = c(\"white\", \"lightgreen\", \"darkgreen\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(elections_by_counties, aes(map_id = county_fips, fill = median_age)) +\n  geom_map(map = county_map) +\n  expand_limits(x = county_map$long, y = county_map$lat) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") + \n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_fill_gradientn(name = \"median age\", colors = terrain.colors(10))",

This is a very broad topic, and we’ll focus here on data visualization alone. Relatedly, and at a minimum:\n\nData viz should not mislead, i.e. “wrong” viz are unethical.**\nYet ethics in data viz goes much deeper. Correll describes three related principles to strive for:\n\nVisibility\nMake the invisible visible. Visualize hidden labor, hidden uncertainty, hidden impacts. Credit your sources, data and otherwise.\nPrivacy\nCollect data with empathy. Encourage small Data, anthropomorphize data, obfuscate data to protect privacy.\nPower\nChallenge structures of power. Support data due process, act as data advocates, pressure unethical analytical behavior.\n\nTo this list, Data Feminism authors Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F.

    "text": "5.2 Exercises\n\nExercise 1: Professionalism\nLet’s examine weather in 3 Australian locations.\nThe following plot is fine for things like homework or just playing around. But we’ll make it more “professional” looking below.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nReplace A, B, C, and D in the code below to:\n\nAdd a short, but descriptive title. Under 10 words.\nChange the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.\nChange the legend title to “Location” (just for practice, not because it’s better than “location”).\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9am (ºC)\", y = \"Temperature at 3pm (ºC)\", title = \"Temperature Variation at 9am and 3pm\", color = \"Location\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhen we’re including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature at 9am (ºC)\", y = \"Temperature at 3pm (ºC)\", color = \"Location\")  \n\n\n\n\nScatterplot of temperature variation at 9am vs 3pm at different Australian locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then knit your Rmd, and hover over the image in your knitted html file to check out the alt text.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz?\n\n\n\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\n\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\n\n\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz. \nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:\n\nemphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?\nimprove upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?\n\n\n\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\n\n\n\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\n\n\n\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\n\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\n\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions:\n\nWhat story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?\nCan the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.\nCritique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\n\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n\n\n\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\n\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png for an image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping up\nIf you finish early:\n\nWork on homework if not done already\nComplete any activities you haven’t finished yet, eg, spatial viz, the optional but fun exercises in the Multivariate viz and Bivariate viz activities.\nIf you’ve done all that, explore some datasets in TidyTuesday.",

    "text": "6.2 Warm-Up\nThere are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\n\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\n\narrange\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\nfilter\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\nselect\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\nmutate\nmutate or create a column\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\ngroup_by\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\nget only the data on Minnesota\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2: select columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# What's the first argument? The second?\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3: filter rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4: filter and select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: order of operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters. For example: putting on socks, then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes, then socks. Sometimes order doesn’t matter. For example: Pouring cereal into a bowl, then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bowl, then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Try it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: Storing the results\nTypically:\n\nWe want to store our data wrangling results.\nIt’s good practice to do so under a new name. We want to preserve, thus don’t want to overwrite, the original data (especially if our code contains errors!!).\n\n\n# Store the results\nmn &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n# Always check it out to confirm it's what you want it to be!\nhead(mn)\n\n  state_name      county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16\n1  Minnesota    Aitkin County      35.98      34.12\n2  Minnesota     Anoka County      47.79      41.01\n3  Minnesota    Becker County      33.96      30.47\n4  Minnesota  Beltrami County      47.24      40.76\n5  Minnesota    Benton County      32.70      28.33\n6  Minnesota Big Stone County      35.41      33.75\n\nnrow(mn)\n\n[1] 87\n\nnrow(elections)\n\n[1] 3109",

This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\nmn_wi &lt;- elections_small %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) %&gt;% \n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(dem_pct_change = dem_pct_20 - dem_pct_16) %&gt;% \n  arrange(dem_pct_change)\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\nhead(mn_wi)\n\n  state_name        county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16 dem_pct_change\n1  Minnesota     Stevens County      37.80      39.55          -1.75\n2  Wisconsin      Forest County      34.06      35.12          -1.06\n3  Wisconsin    Kewaunee County      32.87      33.73          -0.86\n4  Wisconsin       Clark County      30.37      31.19          -0.82\n5  Wisconsin       Adams County      36.63      37.40          -0.77\n6  Wisconsin Trempealeau County      40.86      41.57          -0.71\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: summarize demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   class()\n# \n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   class()\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\n\n# Sort the *states* from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each *state*?\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n\n\n\nPart b\n\n# Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n# HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each state?\n# HINT: First calculate the number of Dem and Repub votes in each *county*\n# Then group and summarize these by state\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n# HINT: Start with the results from the previous chunk, and then keep only some rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Practice on new data\nRecall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\n\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\n\n# In what years did Brazil win the World Cup?\n\n\n# What were the 6 World Cups with the highest attendance?\n\n\n# Construct a univariate plot of goals_scored (no wrangling necessary)\n# This provides a visual summary of how the number of goals_scored varies from World Cup to World Cup\n\n\n# Let's follow up the plot with some more precise numerical summaries\n# Calculate the min, median, and max number of goals_scored across all World Cups\n# NOTE: Visually compare these numerical summaries to what you observed in the plot\n\n\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the number of goals_scored in the World Cup has changed over the years\n# No wrangling necessary\n\n\n# Our above summaries might be a bit misleading.\n# The number of games played at the World Cup varies.\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the typical number of goals per game has changed over the years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11: Practice on your data\nReturn to the TidyTuesday data you’re using in Homework 3.

    "text": "Data Science Process\nBelow is the visual representation of the data science process we saw earlier. Which stage are we in currently?\n\nRecall that wrangling is important. It is much of what we spend our efforts on in Data Science. There are lots of steps, hence R functions, that can go into data wrangling. But we can get far with the following 6 wrangling verbs:\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\n\narrange\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\nfilter\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\nselect\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\nmutate\nmutate or create a column\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\ngroup_by\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Single Verb\nLet’s start by working with some TidyTuesday data on penguins. This data includes information about penguins’ flippers (“arms”) and bills (“mouths” or “beaks”). Let’s import this using read_csv(), a function in the tidyverse package. For the most part, this is similar to read.csv(), though read_csv() can be more efficient at importing large datasets.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\npenguins &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins.csv')\n\n# Check it out\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nConstruct a plot that allows us to examine how the relationship between body mass and bill length varies by species and sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nUse the 6 wrangling verbs to address each task in the code chunk below. You can tack on |&gt; head() to print out just 6 rows to keep your rendered document manageable. Most of these require just 1 verb.\n\n\n\n# Get data on only Adelie penguins that weigh more than 4700g\n\n\n# Get data on penguin body mass only\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n# Sort the penguins from smallest to largest body mass\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n\n# Calculate the average body mass across all penguins\n# Note: na.rm = TRUE removes the NAs from the calculation\n\n\n\n# Calculate the average body mass by species\n\n\n\n# Create a new column that records body mass in kilograms, not grams\n# NOTE: there are 1000 g in 1 kg\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nHow many penguins of each species do we have? Create a viz that addresses this question.\n\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nCan we use the 6 verbs to calculate exactly how many penguins in each species?\nHINT: n() calculates group size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount verb\n\n\n\nThe count() verb provides a handy shortcut!\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  count(species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  species       n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie      152\n2 Chinstrap    68\n3 Gentoo      124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Multiple Verbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nLet’s practice combining some verbs. For each task:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs. That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\nAsk what you can rearrange and still get the same result.\nRead your final code like a paragraph / a conversation. Would another person be able to follow your logic?\n\n\n\n\n# Sort Gentoo penguins from biggest to smallest with respect to their \n# bill length in cm (there are 10 mm in a cm)\n\n\n# Sort the species from smallest to biggest with respect to their \n# average bill length in cm\n\n\n\nExample 3: Interpret Code\nLet’s practice reading and making sense of somebody else’s code. What do you think this produces?\n\nHow many columns? Rows?\nWhat are the column names?\nWhat’s represented in each row?\n\nOnce you’ve thought about it, put the code inside a chunk and run it!\npenguins %&gt;% filter(species == “Chinstrap”) %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarize(min = min(body_mass_g), max = max(body_mass_g)) %&gt;% mutate(range = max - min)",

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\nit can remove a lot of observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins %&gt;% \n  select(-year & -island)\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 6\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195        4675 male  \n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193        3475 &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190        4250 &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins %&gt;% \n  select(species | ends_with(\"mm\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 4\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193\n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins %&gt;% \n  select(species | starts_with(\"bill\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n 4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1\n10 Adelie            42            20.2\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins %&gt;% \n  select(species | contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2024-10-04\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today)\n\n[1] 2024\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nmonth(today)\n\n[1] 10\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Oct\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\n\n\n# What does this number mean?\nweek(today)\n\n[1] 40\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nmday(today)\n\n[1] 4\n\nyday(today)  # This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 278\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nwday(today)\n\n[1] 6\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Fri\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\n\n# What do the results of these 2 lines tell us?\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE",

    "text": "7.3 Exercises Part 2: Application\nThe remaining exercises are similar to some of those on the homework. Hence, the solutions are not provided. Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nBirthdays gives the number of births recorded on each day of the year in each state from 1969 to 19881. We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\n\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\n\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\n\n\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\n\n\n\nExercise 8: More Practice\n\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\n\n\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",

Since penguin_avg is small, we could do these calculations by hand. But this doesn’t scale up to bigger datasets.\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\nWider vs Longer formats\nMaking our data longer or wider reshapes the data, changing the units of observation while retaining all raw information:\nEXAMPLE 5: pivot wider\nBecause it’s a small enough dataset to examine all at once, let’s start with our penguin_avg data:\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\nWith the goal of being able to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species, let’s make the dataset wider. That is, let’s get one row per species with separate columns for the average body mass by sex. Put this code into a chunk and run it:\npenguin_avg |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\nFOLLOW-UP:\nEXAMPLE 6: Pivot longer\nLet’s store our wide data:\npenguin_avg_wide &lt;- penguin_avg |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\npenguin_avg_wide\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\nSuppose we wanted to change this data back to a longer format. In general, this happens when some variables (here female and male) represent two categories or values of some broader variable (here sex), and we want to combine them into that 1 variable without losing any information. Let’s pivot_longer():\n# We can either communicate which variables we WANT to collect into a single column (female, male)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(female, male), names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n# Or which variable(s) we do NOT want to collect into a single column (sex)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -species, names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\nFOLLOW-UP:\nEXAMPLE 7: Practice\nLet’s make up some data on the orders of 2 different customers at 3 different restaurants:\nfood &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 3),\n  restaurant = rep(c(\"Shish\", \"FrenchMeadow\", \"DunnBros\"), 2),\n  order = c(\"falafel\", \"salad\", \"coffee\", \"baklava\", \"pastry\", \"tea\")\n)\nfood\n\n  customer   restaurant   order\n1        A        Shish falafel\n2        A FrenchMeadow   salad\n3        A     DunnBros  coffee\n4        B        Shish baklava\n5        B FrenchMeadow  pastry\n6        B     DunnBros     tea\nThe units of observation in food are customer / restaurant combinations. Wrangle this data so that the units of observation are customers, spreading the restaurants into separate columns.\nConsider 2 more customers:\nmore_food &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = c(\"C\", \"D\"),\n  Shish = c(\"coffee\", \"maza\"),\n  FrenchMeadow = c(\"soup\", \"sandwich\"),\n  DunnBros = c(\"cookie\", \"coffee\")\n)\nmore_food\n\n  customer  Shish FrenchMeadow DunnBros\n1        C coffee         soup   cookie\n2        D   maza     sandwich   coffee\nWrangle this data so that the 3 restaurant columns are combined into 1, hence the units of observation are customer / restaurant combinations.",

There are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHints:\n\nShould you first pivot wider or longer?\nOnce you pivot, the week number is turned into a character variable. How can you change it to a number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Practice with the Daily Show\nThe data associated with this article is available in the fivethirtyeight package, and is loaded into daily below. It includes a list of every guest to ever appear on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, a “late-night talk and satirical news” program (per Wikipedia). Check out the dataset and note that when multiple people appeared together, each person receives their own line:\n\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\ndata(\"daily_show_guests\")\ndaily &lt;- daily_show_guests\n\nIn analyzing this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped.\n\nPart a\nIdentify the 15 guests that appeared the most. (This isn’t a very diverse guest list!)\n\n\nPart b\nCHALLENGE: Create the following data set containing 19 columns:\n\nThe first column should have the 15 guests with the highest number of total appearances on the show, listed in descending order of number of appearances.\n17 columns should show the number of appearances of the corresponding guest in each year from 1999 to 2015 (one per column).\nAnother column should show the total number of appearances for the corresponding guest over the entire duration of the show.\n\nThere are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHINTS: There are lots of ways to do this. You don’t necessarily need all of these hints.\n\nFirst obtain the number of times a guest appears each year.\nTo this, add a new column which includes the total number of times a guest appears across all years.\nPivot (longer or wider?). When you do, use values_fill = 0 to replace NA values with 0.\nArrange, then and keep the top 15.\n\n\n\nPart c\nLet’s recreate the first figure from the article. This groups all guests into 3 broader occupational categories. However, our current data has 18 categories:\n\ndaily |&gt; \n  count(group)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   group              n\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Academic         103\n 2 Acting           930\n 3 Advocacy          24\n 4 Athletics         52\n 5 Business          25\n 6 Clergy             8\n 7 Comedy           150\n 8 Consultant        18\n 9 Government        40\n10 Media            751\n11 Military          16\n12 Misc              45\n13 Musician         123\n14 Political Aide    36\n15 Politician       308\n16 Science           28\n17 media              5\n18 &lt;NA&gt;              31\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that includes a new variable, broad_group, that buckets these 18 categories into the 3 bigger ones used in the article. And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.",

Data Viz\nData Viz: displaying data in such a way that we can glean more information about the data, such as patterns, typical outcomes, and distribution.\n\n10.0.1 Components of graphs:\n\nframe (sets up the grid and axes)\nlayer (adds the geometric elements that make up the graph, called geom_ in ggplot)\nscales (changes color/size/shape/etc)\nfaceting (splits up the data )\ntheme (finer scale adjustments like font size)\n\n\n\n10.0.2 For one variable viz:\n\ncategorical: bar plot\nnumerical: histogram/density plot\n\nggplot syntax:\n\nggplot(data = ___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\n\n10.0.3 When discussing data visualizations, you typically look at:\n\ntypical outcome\nvariability + range\nshape\noutliers\n\n\n\n\n11 4. Bivariate Viz\nAnother way to look at the data is to look at relationships within the data. There are - Repsonse variables (dependent variables) - Predictors (independent variables)\n\n11.0.1 What plots to use:\n\n2 quantitative: scatterplot\n2 categorical: stacked bar/facet wrapped bar plot\n1 quantitative, 1 categorical: violin plot, boxplot, stacked density plots.\n\n\n\n\n12 5. Multivariate Viz\nWhich chart to use:\n\n3 cat: bar (x, color, facet)\n2 cat, 1 num: histogram/density (color, facet, x), box, violin (x, facet, y)\n1 cat, 2 num: scatter (facet/color/shape, x, y), heatmap (y, x, shade), star (y, size, )\n3 num: scatter (x, y, size/shade)\n\n\n\n13 6. Spatial Viz\n\nPoint map: a map that specific locations are plotted on (ex: favorite places in the twin cities).\nContour map: plotting density/distribution on a map rather than individual points\nChoropleth Maps: plotting outcomes in different regions (ex: percentage of democratic votes in each state)\n\nLeaflet: a package that can be used to make interactive maps, commonly point maps common functions for leaflet:\n\nleaflet() (makes the leaflet)\naddTiles() (makes the base map)\naddMarkers()\naddPolygons()\nprint() (need to print to see the leaflet)\n\nggplot is typically better for making chloropleth maps than leaflet.\n\n\n14 7. Effective Viz\nEffective visualizations are important in order to accurately portray your data in a way that people can understand.\nVisualizations can be good, ugly, bad, or wrong.\n\nGood: viz is clear, easy to understand, accessible, and helpful.\nUgly: nothing is incorrect about the viz, but the overall aesthetic is ugly\nBad: the viz is “unclear, confusing, overly complicated, or deceiving”\nWrong: viz is incorrectly displaying the data and/or the trends\n\nIn order to have effective viz you need to:\n\nhave clear, concise titles/axes\ninclude a figure caption\ninclude an alt caption, for screen readers\navoid using overly similar colors whenever possible\nadd context\nmake data anonymous when possible\n\n\n\n15 8. Wrangling Verbs\ntidyverse has many helpful functions that allow us to wrangle the data into a way that we can meaningfully create data viz.\n99.99% of data will not be entirely clean and ready to use. You will have to clean and reformat the data in order to use it.\nSome key functions to use are:\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\n\narrange\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\nfilter\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\nselect\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\nmutate\nmutate or create a column\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\ngroup_by\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n16 9. Wrangling + Dates\nOrder of the functions matter. If you want to arrange by one column but then only include 2 different columns in your final data frame, you need to do arrange first before selecting the columns or else you will get an error.\nKey syntax for filtering:\n\n\n\nsymbol\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n%in% c(***, ***)\na list of multiple values\n\n\n\nsummarize ex:\n\npenguins |&gt; filter(species == “Chinstrap”) |&gt; group_by(sex) |&gt; summarize(min = min(body_mass_g), max = max(body_mass_g)) |&gt; mutate(range = max - min)",
