When do we use it? - the + indicates that another function is being added to the ggplot function.\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? - It indicates that the graph is geometric\nWhat does labs() stand for? - labs() stands for labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? - color changes the color of the border, fill changes the color of the entire bar.\nPart b In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable: observed categories: What categories did we observe? - difficulty\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? - moderate is by far the most common category\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nPart c Is there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again. - the x-axis is in alphabetical order not order of difficulty.\nExercise 6\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is NOT an effective visualization because it creates a new bar for every unique elevation, making the bars small and difficult to read as very few peaks have the exact same elevation.\nExercise 8\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
